            description: >
              Event properties are attributes of the events your users fire, and which you then send to Amplitude. Each event will have its own set of event properties. The nature of these properties depends on both the type of product you have, and the specific information you're most interested in discovering. For instance, if Swipe is an event you're tracking, the event property Direction could have the values Left or Right.
              Some example event properties are description, category, type, duration, level, percent completed, count, source, status, number, lives, authenticated, error number, rank, action, and mode.

              client_upload_time) 2015-08-10T12:00:00.000000 We use this timestamp to
              organize events on Amplitude charts. Note: If the difference between
              server_received_time and client_upload_time is less than 60 seconds, the
              event_time will not be adjusted and will equal the client_event_time
